    <strong>Steps to make Lasagna</strong>

    <ol>
       <li>ir the risotto often, but not constantly. If you stir the rice too much, it will become gluey. If you don't stir it enough, though, it won't be creamy and it will stick to the bottom and burn</li>
       <li>ke sure the chicken broth is warm or at least room temperature before you add it to the rice. Cold liquid won't cook through as well.</li>
       <li>e a pot that fits just over the burner. If the pot is too wide, the rice will cook in a thin layer. This isn't ideal for creamy, rich risotto.</li>
