    <strong>Steps to make Lemon Cramb Bars</strong>

    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a 9x9-inch square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides</li>
       <li>For crust and crumb, stir together melted butter, white sugar, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add in flour and baking powder and mix until mixture comes together in large clumps. Measure out a loosely-packed 1 3/4 cups crumbs and press firmly and evenly into the bottom of prepared pan. Reserve remaining crumb mixture for topping.</li>
       <li>Break an egg into a large bowl and whisk for a few seconds. Lightly brush a thin layer of egg over the crust; you will use any egg left in the filling. Place crust into the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes while you prepare filling.</li>
